"""
Swarm Suite — WebSocket Connection Manager

Manages active WebSocket connections and provides broadcasting capabilities
for real-time updates across the platform.

Supports:
  - Global broadcasts (all connected clients)
  - Targeted broadcasts by mission or agent channel
  - Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
  - User presence tracking (who's online)
